## Quick Start

Get KrakenHashes running in under 5 minutes with Docker!

**Requirements:** Docker Engine 19.03.0+ and Docker Compose v2.0+

```bash
# Download and run
mkdir krakenhashes && cd krakenhashes
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ZerkerEOD/krakenhashes/master/docker-compose.yml
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ZerkerEOD/krakenhashes/master/.env.example
cp .env.example .env # Edit .env to set passwords
```

Once the .env has been edited you can run the following
```bash
docker compose up -d  # Note: use 'docker compose' not 'docker-compose'
```
