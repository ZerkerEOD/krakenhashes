# KrakenHashes Glossary

This glossary provides definitions for terms used throughout the KrakenHashes system, organized by category.

## Password Cracking Terminology

### A-Z

**Attack Mode**: The method used by hashcat to attempt password recovery. Common modes include dictionary attack (-a 0), combinator attack (-a 1), brute-force/mask attack (-a 3), and hybrid attacks (-a 6, -a 7).

**Benchmark**: A test run to measure the cracking speed (hashes per second) of specific hardware against various hash algorithms.

**Brute Force Attack**: An attack method that systematically tries all possible character combinations within a defined character set and length range.

**Candidate**: A potential password generated during the cracking process that will be tested against the target hash.

**Charset**: A defined set of characters used in mask or brute-force attacks (e.g., ?l = lowercase, ?u = uppercase, ?d = digits, ?s = special characters).

**Combinator Attack**: An attack that combines words from two wordlists to create password candidates (e.g., "password" + "123" = "password123").

**Cracked Hash**: A hash that has been successfully reversed to reveal its plaintext password.

**Dictionary Attack**: An attack using a wordlist of common passwords and variations to attempt hash cracking.

**Hash**: A one-way cryptographic function output that represents a password. Common types include MD5, SHA1, SHA256, bcrypt, and NTLM.

**Hash Algorithm**: The specific cryptographic function used to create a hash (e.g., MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256, bcrypt, scrypt, Argon2).

**Hash Rate**: The speed at which password candidates are tested, measured in hashes per second (H/s), kilohashes/s (KH/s), megahashes/s (MH/s), or gigahashes/s (GH/s).

**Hashcat**: The underlying password recovery tool used by KrakenHashes for distributed cracking operations.

**Hashlist**: A collection of password hashes to be cracked, typically organized by source, client, or campaign.

**Hybrid Attack**: An attack combining wordlist entries with masks or rules to generate password candidates.

**Keyspace**: The total number of possible password combinations for a given attack configuration.

**Mask**: A pattern defining the structure of passwords to generate in a mask attack (e.g., ?u?l?l?l?d?d?d?d for Abcd1234 format).

**Mask Attack**: A targeted brute-force approach using patterns to generate password candidates based on known password structures.

**Password Candidate**: A potential password being tested against a hash during the cracking process.

**Plaintext**: The original, unencrypted password that produces a given hash.

**Potfile**: A file storing previously cracked hashes and their plaintext passwords to avoid redundant work.

**Rainbow Table**: Pre-computed tables of hash-to-plaintext mappings (not used by hashcat/KrakenHashes).

**Rule**: A transformation applied to wordlist entries to generate password variants (e.g., appending numbers, capitalizing letters, character substitution).

**Rule Splitting**: KrakenHashes feature that divides large rule files into chunks for distributed processing across multiple agents.

**Salt**: Random data added to passwords before hashing to prevent identical passwords from producing identical hashes.

**Wordlist**: A file containing potential passwords, one per line, used as input for dictionary attacks.

## System Architecture Terms

### A-Z

**Agent**: A compute node running the KrakenHashes agent software that executes hashcat jobs and reports results to the backend.

**Agent Pool**: A group of agents that can be assigned to work together on jobs.

**API Key**: Authentication credential used by agents to communicate with the backend server.

**Backend**: The central KrakenHashes server that manages jobs, stores data, and coordinates agent activities.

**Claim Code**: A one-time voucher code used to register new agents with the system.

**Client**: In KrakenHashes context, a customer or engagement for which password cracking services are performed.

**Chunk**: A portion of work (keyspace segment or rule subset) assigned to an individual agent for processing.

**Chunking**: The process of dividing large cracking jobs into smaller segments for distributed processing.

**Data Retention**: Policies and mechanisms for automatically removing old data based on configured time periods.

**Heartbeat**: Regular status updates sent by agents to the backend to indicate they are alive and processing.

**Job**: A single password cracking task with specific parameters, wordlists, rules, and target hashes.

**Job Execution**: An instance of a job being run, which may involve multiple agents and chunks.

**Job Template**: A reusable job configuration that can be applied to different hashlists.

**Job Workflow**: A sequence of jobs designed to implement a comprehensive attack strategy.

**Preset**: Pre-configured job templates or workflows for common attack scenarios.

**Repository Pattern**: Software design pattern used in KrakenHashes for database access abstraction.

**Service Layer**: Business logic layer in the backend that processes requests between handlers and repositories.

**WebSocket**: Protocol used for real-time bidirectional communication between agents and the backend.

**Work Directory**: Temporary directory where agents store files and data during job execution.

## Security and Authentication Terms

### A-Z

**2FA/MFA**: Two-Factor/Multi-Factor Authentication requiring multiple verification methods for user login.

**Access Token**: Short-lived JWT token used for API authentication.

**API Authentication**: Token-based authentication system for programmatic access to KrakenHashes.

**Backup Codes**: One-time use codes for account recovery when primary MFA method is unavailable.

**RBAC**: Role-Based Access Control - authorization system based on user roles (admin, user, agent, system).

**Refresh Token**: Long-lived token used to obtain new access tokens without re-authentication.

**Self-Signed Certificate**: TLS certificate signed by its creator rather than a trusted CA.
