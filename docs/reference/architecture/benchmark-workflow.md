# Benchmark-Based Job Assignment Workflow

## Overview

The job scheduling service now implements a benchmark-first approach for job assignment. Before assigning work to an agent, the system verifies that the agent has a valid benchmark for the specific attack mode and hash type combination.

## Workflow

1. **Job Assignment Request**
   - Scheduler identifies an available agent and a pending job
   - Job execution details are retrieved, including the hashlist

2. **Benchmark Check**
   - System checks if agent has a benchmark for the attack mode and hash type
   - If benchmark exists, checks if it's still valid (default: 7 days cache)
   - Cache duration can be configured via `benchmark_cache_duration_hours` setting

3. **Benchmark Request (if needed)**
   - If no valid benchmark exists, system sends enhanced benchmark request
   - Request includes actual job configuration:
     - Binary version
     - Wordlists and rules (if applicable)
     - Mask (for brute force attacks)
     - Hash type and attack mode
     - Test duration (30 seconds)
   - Job assignment is deferred until benchmark completes

4. **Benchmark Execution (Agent side)**
   - Agent receives benchmark request with full job configuration
   - Runs actual hashcat benchmark with the specific parameters
   - Reports back real-world performance metrics

5. **Job Assignment (after benchmark)**
   - Once benchmark is received and stored, agent becomes available again
   - Next scheduling cycle will find the valid benchmark
   - Chunk calculation uses accurate performance data
   - Job task is assigned with properly sized chunks

## Benefits

- **Accurate Performance Estimation**: Benchmarks use actual job configuration
- **Optimal Chunk Sizing**: Prevents under/over-utilization of agents
- **Reduced Job Failures**: Avoids assigning work that agents can't handle
- **Better Resource Utilization**: Chunks are sized based on real performance

## Configuration

- `benchmark_cache_duration_hours`: How long benchmarks remain valid (default: 168 hours / 7 days)
- `chunk_fluctuation_percentage`: Tolerance for final chunk size variations (default: 20%)
- `default_chunk_duration`: Target duration for each chunk in seconds (default: 1200 / 20 minutes)

## Implementation Details

### Modified Components

1. **JobSchedulingService** (`assignWorkToAgent`)
   - Added benchmark validation before chunk calculation
   - Defers assignment if benchmark is needed
   - Retrieves hashlist to get hash type

2. **JobWebSocketIntegration** (`RequestAgentBenchmark`)
   - New method implementing the interface
   - Sends enhanced benchmark request with full job configuration
   - Includes wordlists, rules, mask, and binary information

3. **WebSocket Types**
   - `BenchmarkRequestPayload` enhanced with job-specific fields
   - Supports real-world speed testing with actual attack parameters

### Error Handling

- Missing benchmarks trigger requests instead of failures
- Invalid benchmarks are detected and refreshed
- WebSocket unavailability is properly handled
- Graceful degradation if benchmark request fails

## Accurate Keyspace Tracking

In addition to benchmarking for performance estimation, the system captures accurate keyspace values from hashcat to ensure precise progress tracking.

### Why Accurate Keyspace Tracking?

When using rules or combination attacks, estimating the total keyspace can be inaccurate. For example:
- **Rule-based attacks**: Estimated keyspace = wordlist_size Ã— rule_count, but actual keyspace varies based on rule effectiveness
- **Combination attacks**: Certain combinations may be invalid or duplicates

Hashcat provides the actual keyspace through `progress[1]` values, which the system captures to ensure accurate progress reporting.

### Keyspace Capture Workflow

1. **Initial Job Creation**
   - Job created with estimated `effective_keyspace` based on wordlists/rules
   - Flag `is_accurate_keyspace` set to `false`
   - Estimation needed for rule splitting decisions

2. **Forced Benchmark for First Agent**
   - When first agent connects (taskCount = 0), system requests benchmark
   - Benchmark includes actual job configuration (wordlists, rules, mask, hash type)
   - Agent runs hashcat benchmark and captures `progress[1]` value

3. **Accurate Keyspace Capture**
   - Backend receives benchmark result with `TotalEffectiveKeyspace` from `progress[1]`
   - Updates job execution:
     - Sets `effective_keyspace` to actual value from hashcat
     - Sets `is_accurate_keyspace` to `true`
     - Calculates `avg_rule_multiplier` = actual / estimated
   - Subsequent agents skip benchmark and use cached job-level keyspace

4. **Fallback: First Progress Update**
   - If benchmark doesn't provide keyspace, first task progress update does
   - Agent sends `progress[1]` value in first progress message with `IsFirstUpdate` flag
   - Backend updates both job-level and task-level keyspace
   - Sets `is_actual_keyspace` to `true` for the task

5. **Future Task Improvements**
   - New tasks use `avg_rule_multiplier` to improve estimated keyspace
   - Provides better estimates for chunks not yet processed
   - Helps with more accurate progress reporting across the job

### Benefits of Accurate Keyspace Tracking

- **Precise Progress**: Progress percentages reflect actual hashcat progress, not estimates
- **Better Task Distribution**: Chunk sizes calculated based on real keyspace
- **Improved Estimates**: Future tasks benefit from multiplier derived from actual values
- **Consistency**: All agents working on same job use same accurate keyspace

### Database Columns

**job_executions table:**
- `is_accurate_keyspace` (boolean): True when keyspace is from hashcat `progress[1]`
- `avg_rule_multiplier` (float): Ratio of actual/estimated keyspace for improving future estimates

**job_tasks table:**
- `is_actual_keyspace` (boolean): True when task has actual keyspace from progress update

## Hashlist Download Strategy for Benchmarks

### Always-Fresh Hashlist Downloads

To ensure accurate keyspace calculations, benchmarks ALWAYS download a fresh copy of the hashlist from the backend, even if a local copy exists. This prevents stale hash counts from affecting keyspace estimates.

**Why This Matters**:
- Hashlists change as hashes are cracked and files are regenerated
- Benchmark keyspace must reflect the CURRENT number of uncracked hashes
- Stale local copies can lead to incorrect `effective_keyspace` values
- Cross-hashlist crack propagation means files update frequently

**Implementation**:
```go
// Agent removes existing hashlist before benchmark
if _, err := os.Stat(localPath); err == nil {
    debug.Info("Removing existing hashlist to download fresh copy for benchmark")
    os.Remove(localPath)
}

// Download fresh copy from backend
fileInfo := &filesync.FileInfo{
    Name:     fmt.Sprintf("%d.hash", hashlistID),
    FileType: "hashlist",
    ID:       int(hashlistID),
    MD5Hash:  "", // Skip verification for speed
}
c.fileSync.DownloadFileFromInfo(ctx, fileInfo)
```

**Benchmark Workflow with Fresh Download**:
1. Backend requests benchmark for job execution
2. Agent receives benchmark request with hashlist ID
3. Agent deletes any existing local hashlist file
4. Agent downloads current version from backend (may be empty if all cracked)
5. Agent runs hashcat benchmark with fresh hashlist
6. Agent reports actual keyspace from `progress[1]`

**Benefits**:
- Keyspace values always accurate
- Benchmarks work correctly even after massive crack batches
- Prevents "empty hashlist" errors from hashcat
- Consistent behavior across all agents

**Performance Impact**:
- Minimal: Hashlists are typically < 10 MB
- Download completes in seconds over LAN
- Only occurs once per job (first agent)
- Subsequent agents use job-level cached keyspace

### Task Execution Strategy

Similar to benchmarks, job tasks also ALWAYS re-download hashlists:

**Rationale**:
- Ensures consistent behavior between benchmarks and tasks
- Prevents agents from working with stale data
- Handles cross-hashlist crack propagation automatically
- Eliminates edge cases with modified local files

**Implementation**:
```go
// Agent ensures fresh hashlist for each task
if _, err := os.Stat(localPath); err == nil {
    debug.Info("Removing existing hashlist to download fresh copy")
    os.Remove(localPath)
}

// Download current version
s.fileSync.DownloadFileFromInfo(ctx, fileInfo)
```

**Trade-offs**:
- Slightly higher network usage
- Guaranteed data freshness
- Simplified agent logic (no staleness checks)
- Better fault tolerance
