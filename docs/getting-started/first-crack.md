# Your First Password Crack

This guide walks you through performing your first password crack with KrakenHashes. By the end of this tutorial, you'll understand the complete workflow from setup to viewing results.

!!! note "Prerequisites"
    - KrakenHashes is installed and running
    - You're logged in as an admin user
    - You have access to a hashcat binary file
    - At least one agent machine is available (can be the same as the server)

## Step 1: Upload Hashcat Binary

First, we need to upload the hashcat binary that agents will use to perform the actual cracking.

### Navigate to Binary Management

1. From the main menu, click **Admin** â†’ **Binary Management**
2. Click the **Add Binary** button in the top right

![Binary Management Page](../assets/screenshots/binary-management.png){ .screenshot }

### Upload the Binary

1. In the upload dialog:
   - Click **Choose File** or drag and drop your hashcat binary
   - Supported formats: `.7z`, `.zip`, `.tar.gz`
   - The binary should be compressed and include all necessary files

2. Click **Upload** and wait for the process to complete

!!! tip "Getting Hashcat"
    If you don't have hashcat, download it from [hashcat.net/hashcat/](https://hashcat.net/hashcat/)
    
    For this tutorial, download the appropriate binary for your system:
    - Linux: `hashcat-6.2.6.7z`
    - Windows: `hashcat-6.2.6.exe` (compress to .zip first)

3. After upload, the system will automatically verify the binary
   - Status should show as **verified** âœ“
   - Note the Binary ID for later reference

## Step 2: Upload a Simple Wordlist

Next, let's create a basic wordlist for our first crack attempt.

### Navigate to Wordlist Management

1. From the main menu, click **Resources** â†’ **Wordlists**
2. Click the **Add Wordlist** button

![Wordlist Management](../assets/screenshots/wordlist-management.png){ .screenshot }

### Create a Test Wordlist

For this tutorial, let's create a simple wordlist file:

1. Create a text file named `common-passwords.txt` with these contents:
   ```
   password
   123456
   password123
   admin
   letmein
   welcome
   monkey
   dragon
   ```

2. In the upload dialog:
   - **Name**: "Common Passwords Tutorial"
   - **Description**: "Basic wordlist for first crack tutorial"
   - **Type**: General
   - **File**: Select your `common-passwords.txt`

3. Click **Upload**

!!! info "Wordlist Types"
    - **General**: Standard password lists
    - **Usernames**: Lists of common usernames
    - **Custom**: Specialized wordlists for specific targets

## Step 3: Create a Test Hashlist

Now let's create some password hashes to crack. We'll use known passwords so you can verify the results.

### Prepare Test Hashes

1. Create a file named `test-hashes.txt` with these MD5 hashes:
   ```
   5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99
   e10adc3949ba59abbe56e057f20f883e
   482c811da5d5b4bc6d497ffa98491e38
   ```

!!! note "What are these hashes?"
    These are MD5 hashes of:
    - `password` â†’ 5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99
    - `123456` â†’ e10adc3949ba59abbe56e057f20f883e  
    - `password123` â†’ 482c811da5d5b4bc6d497ffa98491e38

### Upload the Hashlist

1. Navigate to **Hashlists** from the main menu

![Hashlist Management Page](../assets/images/screenshots/hashlist_management.png)
*Hashlist Management page with UPLOAD HASHLIST button highlighted, showing the interface where users can view existing hashlists and initiate new uploads*

2. Click **Upload Hashlist**

![Upload Hashlist Dialog](../assets/screenshots/upload-hashlist.png){ .screenshot }

3. Fill in the details:
   - **Name**: "Tutorial Test Hashes"
   - **Description**: "MD5 hashes for first crack tutorial"
   - **Hash Type**: MD5 (mode 0)
   - **Client**: (Optional - leave blank for tutorial)
   - **File**: Select your `test-hashes.txt`

4. Click **Upload**

The system will process your hashlist and show:
- Total hashes: 3
- Unique hashes: 3
- Status: Active

## Step 4: Connect an Agent

Agents are the worker machines that perform the actual password cracking. Let's connect one.

### Generate a Claim Code

1. Navigate to **Admin** â†’ **Agent Management**
2. Click **Generate Claim Code**

![Agent Management](../assets/screenshots/agent-management.png){ .screenshot }

3. A claim code will be generated (e.g., `ABCD-EFGH-IJKL`)
4. Copy this code - you'll need it for the agent

### Install and Configure the Agent

On your agent machine (can be the same as the server):

1. Download the KrakenHashes agent for your platform
2. Extract it to a directory
3. Run the registration command:
   ```bash
   ./krakenhashes-agent register --server https://your-server:8443 --claim-code ABCD-EFGH-IJKL
   ```

4. The agent will:
   - Register with the server
   - Receive an API key
   - Start heartbeat communication
   - Sync required files (binaries, wordlists)

!!! success "Agent Connected!"
    Once registered, you'll see the agent appear in the Agent Management page with:
    - Status: **Online** ðŸŸ¢
    - Hardware info (GPU details if available)
    - Last heartbeat timestamp

## Step 5: Create and Run a Job

Now for the exciting part - let's crack those passwords!

### Create a New Job

1. Go back to **Hashlists**
2. Find your "Tutorial Test Hashes" and click on it
3. Click **Create Job** button

![Create Job Dialog](../assets/screenshots/create-job.png){ .screenshot }

### Configure the Job

You have three options for creating jobs:

=== "Quick Job (Recommended for Tutorial)"

    1. Select the **Preset Jobs** tab
    2. Choose **"Quick Dictionary Attack"**
    3. This preset includes:
       - Dictionary attack with your wordlists
       - Basic rules for variations
       - Optimized for speed

=== "Custom Job"

    1. Select the **Custom** tab
    2. Configure:
       - **Name**: "Tutorial First Crack"
       - **Attack Mode**: Dictionary (0)
       - **Wordlists**: Select "Common Passwords Tutorial"
       - **Rules**: (Optional - leave empty for now)

=== "Workflow"

    1. Select the **Workflows** tab
    2. Choose a predefined workflow that runs multiple attack strategies

### Start the Job

1. Review your settings
2. Click **Create Job**

The job will be:
