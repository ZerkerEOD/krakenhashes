# Overview

## What is KrakenHashes?

KrakenHashes is a distributed password cracking management system that transforms the power of Hashcat into an enterprise-ready platform. While Hashcat excels as a command-line tool for password recovery, KrakenHashes adds the orchestration, management, and collaboration features needed for professional security teams.

Think of KrakenHashes as the control center for your password auditing operations ‚Äì coordinating multiple machines, managing vast collections of hashes, and providing actionable insights through an intuitive web interface.

## Why KrakenHashes?

### The Challenge with Direct Hashcat Usage

Running Hashcat directly presents several challenges for security teams:

- **Single Machine Limitation**: Hashcat runs on one machine at a time
- **Manual Coordination**: No built-in way to distribute work across multiple systems
- **Limited Visibility**: Command-line output makes it hard to track multiple jobs
- **No Collaboration**: Difficult for teams to share resources and results
- **Manual Management**: Wordlists, rules, and results require manual organization

### The KrakenHashes Solution

KrakenHashes addresses these limitations by providing:

- **Distributed Processing**: Coordinate multiple agents across your infrastructure
- **Centralized Management**: Single interface for all your cracking operations
- **Team Collaboration**: Share resources, results, and strategies
- **Automated Workflows**: Pre-configured attack patterns and job templates
- **Enterprise Features**: Authentication, authorization, and audit trails

    - Execute Hashcat with optimized parameters
    - Monitor hardware health (temperature, usage)
    - Report progress in real-time
    - Automatically sync required files from backend
    - Support scheduling for resource availability

!!! info "Web Interface (React)"
    Modern, responsive UI featuring:
    
    - Real-time job monitoring dashboards
    - Drag-and-drop file uploads
    - Interactive result analysis
    - Administrative controls

## Workflows: Attack Strategy Made Simple

One of KrakenHashes' most powerful features is the workflow system. Instead of manually running different Hashcat commands, you can define comprehensive attack strategies:

### Example: Standard Password Audit Workflow

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Quick Wins] -->|Found: 40%| B[Common Passwords]
    B -->|Found: 15%| C[Rule-Based Attacks]
    C -->|Found: 20%| D[Hybrid Attacks]
    D -->|Found: 10%| E[Brute Force]
    
    style A fill:#90EE90
    style B fill:#87CEEB
    style C fill:#FFB6C1
    style D fill:#FFE4B5
    style E fill:#F0E68C
```

1. **Quick Wins** - Try the most common passwords first
2. **Common Passwords** - Test against known breach compilations
3. **Rule-Based** - Apply transformations to wordlists
4. **Hybrid Attacks** - Combine wordlists with masks
5. **Brute Force** - Last resort for remaining hashes

## Security Considerations

### üõ°Ô∏è Data Protection
