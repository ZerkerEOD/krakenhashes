## Real-time Agent Status

### Agent Status Overview

The system continuously monitors agent status through multiple channels:

```
Active Agents: Online and ready for work
├── Connected: WebSocket connection established
├── Idle: Available for task assignment
├── Busy: Currently executing tasks
└── Reconnecting: Temporary disconnection with recovery in progress

Inactive Agents: Not currently operational
├── Offline: No recent heartbeat or connection
├── Disabled: Administratively disabled
├── Error: Failed connection or system error
└── Pending: Newly registered, awaiting first connection
```

### Agent Connection States

The monitoring system tracks detailed connection states:

| State | Description | Color Indicator | Action Required |
|-------|-------------|----------------|----------------|
| `active` | Connected and operational | 🟢 Green | None |
| `inactive` | Disconnected or offline | 🔴 Red | Check agent service |
| `pending` | Registration in progress | 🟡 Yellow | Wait for completion |
| `disabled` | Administratively disabled | ⚫ Gray | Manual re-enable |
| `error` | System or hardware error | 🔴 Red | Investigate error |

### Agent Dashboard View

Access the agent monitoring dashboard at:
- **Frontend**: `https://your-server:31337/agents`
- **Agent Details**: `https://your-server:31337/agents/{agent_id}`

The dashboard provides:
- Real-time connection status
- Last activity timestamps  
- Device configuration and status
- Performance metrics and charts
- Task assignment history

## Heartbeat and Connection Monitoring

### WebSocket Heartbeat System

KrakenHashes uses a robust WebSocket-based heartbeat system for monitoring agent connectivity:

```
Backend ←→ Agent WebSocket Connection
├── Ping/Pong Messages: Every 54 seconds (configurable)
├── Agent Status Updates: Every 60 seconds
├── Heartbeat Timeout: 60 seconds maximum
└── Automatic Reconnection: Exponential backoff (1s to 30s)
```

### Connection Timing Configuration

The system uses configurable timing parameters:

```bash
# Backend WebSocket Settings (environment variables)
KH_WRITE_WAIT=10s      # Write operation timeout
KH_PONG_WAIT=60s       # Pong response timeout  
KH_PING_PERIOD=54s     # Ping interval

# Agent automatically fetches these from backend
# No manual configuration required
```

### Heartbeat Monitoring Queries

Monitor agent heartbeat status using database queries:

```sql
-- Agents with recent heartbeats (last 5 minutes)
SELECT 
    id,
    name,
    status,
    last_heartbeat,
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (NOW() - last_heartbeat)) AS seconds_since_heartbeat
FROM agents 
WHERE last_heartbeat > NOW() - INTERVAL '5 minutes'
ORDER BY last_heartbeat DESC;

-- Agents with stale heartbeats (potential issues)
SELECT 
    id,
    name, 
    status,
    last_heartbeat,
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (NOW() - last_heartbeat)) AS seconds_since_heartbeat
FROM agents
WHERE last_heartbeat < NOW() - INTERVAL '5 minutes'
  AND status = 'active'
ORDER BY last_heartbeat ASC;

-- Connection status distribution
SELECT status, COUNT(*) as count
FROM agents
GROUP BY status
ORDER BY count DESC;
```

## Metrics Collection and Monitoring

### System Metrics Collection

Agents automatically collect and report system metrics:

#### CPU and Memory Metrics
- **CPU Usage**: Overall processor utilization percentage
- **Memory Usage**: System memory utilization percentage
- **Collection Interval**: 5 seconds (configurable)
- **Data Retention**: Based on monitoring settings

#### Agent Metrics Structure
```go
type MetricsData struct {
    AgentID     int                `json:"agent_id"`
    CollectedAt time.Time          `json:"collected_at"`
    CPUs        []CPUMetrics       `json:"cpus"`
    GPUs        []GPUMetrics       `json:"gpus"`
    Memory      MemoryMetrics      `json:"memory"`
    Disk        []DiskMetrics      `json:"disk"`
    Network     []NetworkMetrics   `json:"network"`
    Process     []ProcessMetrics   `json:"process"`
}
```

### GPU Metrics Integration

GPU metrics are obtained from hashcat's JSON status output during job execution:

- **GPU Utilization**: Device usage percentage
- **GPU Temperature**: Operating temperature in Celsius
- **GPU Memory**: Memory utilization
- **Power Usage**: Power consumption in watts
- **Hash Rate**: Real-time hashing performance

### Metrics Storage and Retention

The system implements a cascading retention policy:

```
Real-time Metrics (Fine-grained)
├── Retention: 7 days (configurable)  
├── Resolution: 5-second intervals
└── Use: Recent activity monitoring

Daily Aggregates (Medium-term)
├── Retention: 30 days (configurable)
├── Resolution: Daily summaries
└── Use: Performance analysis

Weekly Aggregates (Long-term)  
├── Retention: 365 days (configurable)
├── Resolution: Weekly summaries
└── Use: Historical trends
```

### Monitoring Settings Configuration

Configure metrics retention through the admin interface:

```bash
# Access monitoring settings
https://your-server:31337/admin/monitoring

# Available settings:
- Real-time Data Retention: 7 days

    SUM(CASE WHEN ad.enabled THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as enabled_devices
FROM agents a
JOIN agent_devices ad ON a.id = ad.agent_id
GROUP BY ad.device_type
ORDER BY total_devices DESC;

-- Fleet performance overview
SELECT 
    COUNT(DISTINCT a.id) as total_agents,
    COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN a.status = 'active' THEN a.id END) as active_agents,
    AVG(CASE WHEN apm.metric_type = 'utilization' THEN apm.value END) as avg_gpu_utilization,

SELECT 
    SUBSTRING(metadata->>'ipAddress', 1, 
              POSITION('.' IN metadata->>'ipAddress' || '.')) as network_prefix,
    COUNT(*) as agent_count,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN status = 'active' THEN 1 END) as active_count
FROM agents
WHERE metadata ? 'ipAddress'
GROUP BY network_prefix
ORDER BY agent_count DESC;

-- Agents by owner (team/user assignments)
SELECT 
    COALESCE(u.username, 'Unassigned') as owner,
    COUNT(a.id) as agent_count,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN a.status = 'active' THEN 1 END) as active_count
FROM agents a
LEFT JOIN users u ON a.owner_id = u.id  
GROUP BY u.username
ORDER BY agent_count DESC;
```

## Status Indicators and States

### Agent Status State Machine

```
[pending] → [active] → [inactive]
    ↓         ↓           ↓
[error]   [busy/idle]  [disabled]
    ↓         ↓           ↓
[active]  [active]   [active]
```

### Detailed Status Descriptions

| Status | Description | Typical Causes | Recovery Actions |
|--------|-------------|----------------|------------------|
| `pending` | New agent registration | First-time setup | Wait for completion |
| `active` | Fully operational | Normal state | None required |
| `busy` | Executing tasks | Job assignment | Monitor progress |
| `idle` | Connected, available | Between jobs | None required |
| `inactive` | Disconnected | Network/service issues | Restart agent service |
| `disabled` | Manually disabled | Admin action | Re-enable through UI |
| `error` | System/hardware error | Hardware failure, config error | Check logs, fix issues |

### Status Transition Triggers

#### Automatic Transitions
- **pending → active**: Successful device detection and registration
- **active → inactive**: Heartbeat timeout (>5 minutes)
- **active → error**: Device detection failure or system error
- **error → active**: Successful reconnection after error resolution

#### Manual Transitions  
- **Any → disabled**: Administrative disable action
- **disabled → active**: Administrative enable action
- **Any → active**: Force status change through API

### Visual Status Indicators

The web interface uses consistent visual indicators:

```css
/* Status indicator colors */
.status-active     { color: #4caf50; }  /* Green */
.status-inactive   { color: #f44336; }  /* Red */
.status-pending    { color: #ff9800; }  /* Orange */
.status-disabled   { color: #9e9e9e; }  /* Gray */
.status-error      { color: #f44336; }  /* Red */
```

## Performance Analysis and Trends

### Historical Performance Tracking

The system maintains comprehensive historical performance data for trend analysis:

#### Performance Metrics Database Schema

```sql
-- Agent performance metrics table structure
CREATE TABLE agent_performance_metrics (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    agent_id INTEGER REFERENCES agents(id),
    device_name VARCHAR(255),
    metric_type VARCHAR(50),  -- 'temperature', 'utilization', 'fanspeed', 'hashrate'
    value NUMERIC(10,2),
    timestamp TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Benchmark results tracking
CREATE TABLE agent_benchmarks (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    agent_id INTEGER REFERENCES agents(id),
    attack_mode INTEGER,
    hash_type INTEGER, 
    speed BIGINT,
    device_speeds JSONB,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### Performance Analysis Queries

```sql
-- Agent performance trends over time
SELECT 
    DATE_TRUNC('hour', timestamp) as hour,
    AVG(CASE WHEN metric_type = 'utilization' THEN value END) as avg_utilization,
    AVG(CASE WHEN metric_type = 'temperature' THEN value END) as avg_temperature,
    AVG(CASE WHEN metric_type = 'hashrate' THEN value END) as avg_hashrate
FROM agent_performance_metrics
WHERE agent_id = $1
  AND timestamp > NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours'
GROUP BY hour
ORDER BY hour;

-- Top performing agents by hash rate
SELECT 
    a.name,
    AVG(apm.value) as avg_hashrate,
    MAX(apm.value) as peak_hashrate,
    COUNT(apm.id) as measurement_count
FROM agents a
JOIN agent_performance_metrics apm ON a.id = apm.agent_id
WHERE apm.metric_type = 'hashrate'
  AND apm.timestamp > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 week'
GROUP BY a.id, a.name
ORDER BY avg_hashrate DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- Performance degradation detection
WITH recent_performance AS (
    SELECT 
        agent_id,
        AVG(value) as recent_avg
    FROM agent_performance_metrics
    WHERE metric_type = 'hashrate'
      AND timestamp > NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours'
    GROUP BY agent_id
),
baseline_performance AS (
    SELECT 
        agent_id,
        AVG(value) as baseline_avg
    FROM agent_performance_metrics  
    WHERE metric_type = 'hashrate'
      AND timestamp BETWEEN NOW() - INTERVAL '1 week' AND NOW() - INTERVAL '2 days'
    GROUP BY agent_id
)
SELECT 
    a.name,
    r.recent_avg,
    b.baseline_avg,
    ROUND(((r.recent_avg - b.baseline_avg) / b.baseline_avg * 100), 2) as percent_change
FROM agents a
JOIN recent_performance r ON a.id = r.agent_id
JOIN baseline_performance b ON a.id = b.agent_id
WHERE ABS((r.recent_avg - b.baseline_avg) / b.baseline_avg) > 0.15  -- >15% change
ORDER BY percent_change;
```

### Benchmark Performance Tracking

Monitor agent benchmark performance over time:

```sql
-- Benchmark history for agent
SELECT 
    attack_mode,
    hash_type,
    speed,
    created_at,
    LAG(speed) OVER (PARTITION BY attack_mode, hash_type ORDER BY created_at) as previous_speed,
    speed - LAG(speed) OVER (PARTITION BY attack_mode, hash_type ORDER BY created_at) as speed_change
FROM agent_benchmarks
WHERE agent_id = $1
ORDER BY created_at DESC;

-- Fleet benchmark comparison
SELECT 
    a.name,
    ab.attack_mode,
    ab.hash_type,
    ab.speed,
    RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY ab.attack_mode, ab.hash_type ORDER BY ab.speed DESC) as rank
FROM agents a
JOIN agent_benchmarks ab ON a.id = ab.agent_id
WHERE ab.updated_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 week'
ORDER BY ab.attack_mode, ab.hash_type, ab.speed DESC;
```

## Troubleshooting with Monitoring Data

### Common Issues and Diagnostic Approaches

#### 1. Agent Connection Issues

**Symptoms:**
- Agent status shows "inactive" or "error"
- Missing from active agents list
- Stale heartbeat timestamps

**Diagnostic Steps:**
```sql
-- Check agent connection history
SELECT 
    id,
    name,
    status,
    last_heartbeat,
    last_error,
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (NOW() - last_heartbeat)) as seconds_offline
FROM agents
WHERE name = 'problem-agent'
OR id = 123;

-- Check for recent WebSocket errors
```

**Log Analysis:**
```bash
# Check agent logs for connection issues
grep -i "connection\|websocket\|heartbeat" /path/to/agent.log

# Check backend logs for agent-related errors
grep -i "agent.*error\|websocket.*close\|connection.*failed" logs/backend/*.log

# Look for certificate or authentication issues
grep -i "certificate\|auth.*fail\|tls.*error" logs/backend/*.log
```

#### 2. Performance Degradation

**Symptoms:**
- Decreased hash rates
- Higher GPU temperatures
- Reduced utilization

**Diagnostic Queries:**
```sql
-- Performance comparison (current vs historical)
WITH current_perf AS (
    SELECT AVG(value) as current_hashrate
    FROM agent_performance_metrics
    WHERE agent_id = $1 
      AND metric_type = 'hashrate'
      AND timestamp > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour'
),
historical_perf AS (
    SELECT AVG(value) as historical_hashrate
    FROM agent_performance_metrics
    WHERE agent_id = $1
      AND metric_type = 'hashrate' 
      AND timestamp BETWEEN NOW() - INTERVAL '1 week' AND NOW() - INTERVAL '1 day'
)
SELECT 
    c.current_hashrate,
    h.historical_hashrate,
    ((c.current_hashrate - h.historical_hashrate) / h.historical_hashrate * 100) as percent_change
FROM current_perf c, historical_perf h;

-- Temperature analysis
SELECT 
    DATE_TRUNC('hour', timestamp) as hour,
    AVG(value) as avg_temp,
    MAX(value) as max_temp,
    COUNT(*) as measurements
FROM agent_performance_metrics
WHERE agent_id = $1
  AND metric_type = 'temperature'
  AND timestamp > NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours'
GROUP BY hour
ORDER BY hour DESC;
```

#### 3. Hardware Health Issues  

**Symptoms:**
- High GPU temperatures (>85°C)
- Fan speed abnormalities
- Utilization inconsistencies

**Monitoring Approach:**
```sql
-- Hardware health check
SELECT 
    device_name,
    metric_type,
    value,
    timestamp,
    CASE 
        WHEN metric_type = 'temperature' AND value > 85 THEN 'CRITICAL'
        WHEN metric_type = 'temperature' AND value > 75 THEN 'WARNING'
        WHEN metric_type = 'utilization' AND value < 80 THEN 'LOW_UTIL'
        WHEN metric_type = 'fanspeed' AND value > 90 THEN 'HIGH_FAN'
        ELSE 'NORMAL'
    END as status
FROM agent_performance_metrics
WHERE agent_id = $1
  AND timestamp > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour'
  AND (
    (metric_type = 'temperature' AND value > 75)
    OR (metric_type = 'utilization' AND value < 80)
    OR (metric_type = 'fanspeed' AND value > 90)
  )
ORDER BY timestamp DESC;
```

#### 4. Task Assignment Issues

**Symptoms:**
- Agents remain idle during jobs
- Uneven task distribution
- Tasks stuck in "reconnect_pending"

**Diagnostic Queries:**
```sql
-- Check agent busy status and current tasks
SELECT 
    a.name,
    a.status,
    a.metadata->>'busy_status' as busy_status,
    a.metadata->>'current_task_id' as current_task,
    jt.status as task_status,
    je.name as job_name
FROM agents a
LEFT JOIN job_tasks jt ON jt.id = a.metadata->>'current_task_id'  
LEFT JOIN job_executions je ON jt.job_execution_id = je.id
WHERE a.id = $1;

-- Check for reconnect_pending tasks
SELECT 
    jt.id,
    jt.status,
    jt.agent_id,
    a.name,
    jt.keyspace_start,
    jt.keyspace_end,
    jt.updated_at
FROM job_tasks jt
JOIN agents a ON jt.agent_id = a.id
WHERE jt.status = 'reconnect_pending'
ORDER BY jt.updated_at DESC;
```

### Log Analysis Techniques

#### Structured Log Search

```bash
# Find connection events for specific agent
grep -i "agent.*123\|Agent 123" logs/backend/*.log | grep -i "connect"

# Track WebSocket message flow
grep -i "websocket\|message.*type" logs/backend/*.log | tail -50

# Monitor heartbeat activity
grep -i "heartbeat\|ping\|pong" logs/backend/*.log | tail -20

# Check for error patterns
grep -i "error\|fail\|timeout" logs/backend/*.log | grep -i "agent" | tail -10
```

#### Performance Issue Detection

```bash  
# Find performance-related messages
grep -i "performance\|slow\|timeout\|benchmark" logs/backend/*.log

# Check for resource issues
grep -i "memory\|cpu\|disk\|resource" logs/backend/*.log

# Monitor cleanup operations
grep -i "cleanup\|maintenance\|retention" logs/backend/*.log
```

### Automated Issue Detection

Set up monitoring alerts for common issues:

```bash
# Script: monitor_agents.sh
#!/bin/bash

# Check for agents with stale heartbeats
STALE_AGENTS=$(psql -t -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM agents WHERE last_heartbeat < NOW() - INTERVAL '5 minutes' AND status = 'active';")

if [ "$STALE_AGENTS" -gt 0 ]; then
    echo "ALERT: $STALE_AGENTS agents have stale heartbeats"
    # Send notification

## Best Practices

### Monitoring Strategy

#### 1. Proactive Monitoring
- **Set up automated alerts** for critical metrics (heartbeat failures, high temperatures, low utilization)
- **Establish performance baselines** for each agent to detect degradation
- **Monitor trends** rather than just current values
- **Use multiple monitoring approaches** (real-time dashboard + historical analysis)

#### 2. Alert Thresholds
```bash
# Recommended alert thresholds:
Agent Heartbeat: > 5 minutes offline
GPU Temperature: > 85°C sustained  
GPU Utilization: < 50% during jobs
Connection Failures: > 3 consecutive failures
Performance Degradation: > 20% decrease from baseline
```

#### 3. Regular Health Checks
- **Daily**: Review agent status dashboard, check for offline agents
- **Weekly**: Analyze performance trends, identify degradation patterns  
- **Monthly**: Review hardware utilization, plan capacity changes
- **Quarterly**: Update performance baselines, optimize configurations

### Operational Best Practices

#### 1. Fleet Management
- **Group agents** by location, hardware type, or team assignment
- **Use naming conventions** that reflect agent purpose and location
- **Document agent configurations** including hardware specs and special parameters
- **Maintain agent inventory** with ownership and responsibility assignments

#### 2. Performance Optimization
- **Monitor benchmark results** and update when hardware changes
- **Balance task distribution** across agents based on capability
- **Track device utilization** to identify underused resources
- **Optimize extra parameters** for each agent's hardware configuration

#### 3. Maintenance Scheduling  
- **Plan maintenance windows** during low-activity periods
- **Coordinate updates** to minimize impact on running jobs
- **Test configuration changes** on non-critical agents first
- **Document maintenance activities** and their impact on performance

### Monitoring Data Retention

#### 1. Storage Management
```sql
-- Configure retention policies based on needs:
Real-time metrics: 7-14 days (high-frequency data)
Daily aggregates: 30-90 days (performance analysis)  
Weekly aggregates: 1-2 years (long-term trends)
Benchmark results: Indefinite (configuration reference)
```

#### 2. Data Cleanup Automation
- **Enable automatic aggregation** to reduce storage requirements
- **Monitor database growth** and adjust retention as needed
- **Archive historical data** for compliance or analysis needs
- **Use monitoring settings UI** to adjust retention policies

### Security and Access Control

#### 1. Monitoring Access
- **Restrict monitoring access** to appropriate administrators
- **Use role-based permissions** for different monitoring functions
- **Audit monitoring activities** and configuration changes
- **Secure monitoring endpoints** with proper authentication

#### 2. Agent Communication Security
- **Monitor certificate status** and renewal schedules
- **Track authentication failures** and suspicious activity
- **Use secure WebSocket connections** (WSS) in production
- **Regularly rotate API keys** and monitor key usage

### Disaster Recovery and Continuity

#### 1. Monitoring System Availability
- **Implement monitoring redundancy** to avoid single points of failure
- **Backup monitoring configurations** and historical data
- **Test monitoring system recovery** procedures
- **Document escalation procedures** for monitoring system failures

#### 2. Agent Recovery Procedures
- **Automate agent reconnection** with exponential backoff
- **Implement graceful degradation** when agents are offline
- **Buffer critical messages** during disconnections for recovery
- **Track task recovery** and automatic redistribution
