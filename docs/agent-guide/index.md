# Agent Guide

## Overview

Agents are the computational workhorses of KrakenHashes, responsible for executing password cracking jobs using hashcat. This guide covers all aspects of agent deployment, configuration, and management.

## Quick Start

1. **Download the agent binary** from the Releases page
2. **Generate a claim code** in the Admin UI
3. **Register the agent**:
   ```bash
   ./krakenhashes-agent register --code YOUR_CLAIM_CODE --server https://your-server:31337
   ```
4. **Start the agent**:
   ```bash
   ./krakenhashes-agent
   ```

## Key Concepts

### Agent Registration

Agents use a claim code system for secure registration:
- **One-time codes**: Single use, automatically deactivated
- **Continuous codes**: Can register multiple agents
- **API keys**: Generated during registration for ongoing authentication

### Device Support

KrakenHashes agents support multiple device types:
- NVIDIA GPUs (CUDA)
- AMD GPUs (OpenCL)
- Intel GPUs (OpenCL)
- CPU-based cracking (fallback)

### File Management

Agents automatically manage required files:
- Wordlists are downloaded on-demand
- Rules are cached locally
- Hashcat binaries are auto-updated
- All files are verified using checksums

### Security

Agent security features:
- TLS encrypted communication
- API key authentication
- No inbound connections required
- Certificate validation
