# Binary Management

KrakenHashes provides a comprehensive binary management system for hashcat and other password cracking tools. This document explains how to manage binaries, track versions, and ensure secure distribution to agents.

## Overview

The binary management system allows administrators to:
- Upload and manage multiple versions of hashcat binaries
- Track different binary types and compression formats
- Verify binary integrity with MD5 checksums
- Automatically extract and prepare binaries for server-side execution
- Distribute binaries securely to agents
- Maintain an audit trail of all binary operations

## Understanding Binary Management

### Architecture

The binary management system consists of several components:

1. **Binary Storage**: Files are stored in `<data_dir>/binaries/<version_id>/`
2. **Local Extraction**: Server-side binaries are extracted to `<data_dir>/binaries/local/<version_id>/`
3. **Version Tracking**: Database tracks all binary versions with metadata
4. **Distribution**: Agents download binaries via secure API endpoints
5. **Verification**: Automatic integrity checking with MD5 hashes

### Binary Types

Currently supported binary types:
- `hashcat` - Hashcat password cracking tool
- `john` - John the Ripper (future support)

### Compression Types

Supported compression formats:
- `7z` - 7-Zip archive format
- `zip` - ZIP archive format
- `tar.gz` - Gzip-compressed TAR archive
- `tar.xz` - XZ-compressed TAR archive

## Uploading New Binaries

### Via Admin API

To add a new binary version, use the admin API endpoint:

```http
POST /api/admin/binary
Authorization: Bearer <admin_token>
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "binary_type": "hashcat",
  "compression_type": "7z",
  "source_url": "https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/releases/download/v6.2.6/hashcat-6.2.6.7z",
  "file_name": "hashcat-6.2.6.7z"
}
```

The system will:
1. Download the binary from the specified URL
2. Calculate and store the MD5 hash
3. Verify the download integrity
4. Extract the binary for server-side use
5. Mark the version as active and verified

### Upload Process

When a binary is uploaded:

1. **Download Phase**: The system downloads the binary with retry logic (up to 3 attempts)
2. **Verification Phase**: MD5 hash is calculated and stored
3. **Storage Phase**: Binary is saved to `<data_dir>/binaries/<version_id>/`
4. **Extraction Phase**: Archive is extracted to `<data_dir>/binaries/local/<version_id>/`
5. **Status Update**: Version status is set to `verified`

## Version Management and Tracking

### Database Schema

Binary versions are tracked in the `binary_versions` table with the following fields:

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `id` | SERIAL | Unique version identifier |
| `binary_type` | ENUM | Type of binary (hashcat, john) |
| `compression_type` | ENUM | Compression format |
| `source_url` | TEXT | Original download URL |
| `file_name` | VARCHAR(255) | Stored filename |
| `md5_hash` | VARCHAR(32) | MD5 checksum |
| `file_size` | BIGINT | File size in bytes |
| `created_at` | TIMESTAMP | Creation timestamp |
| `created_by` | UUID | User who added the version |
| `is_active` | BOOLEAN | Whether version is active |
| `last_verified_at` | TIMESTAMP | Last verification time |
| `verification_status` | VARCHAR(50) | Status: pending, verified, failed, deleted |

### Verification Status

Binary versions can have the following statuses:
- `pending` - Initial state, download/verification in progress
- `verified` - Successfully downloaded and verified
- `failed` - Download or verification failed
- `deleted` - Binary has been deleted

### Listing Versions

To list all binary versions:

```http
GET /api/admin/binary?type=hashcat&active=true
Authorization: Bearer <admin_token>
```

Query parameters:
- `type` - Filter by binary type
- `active` - Filter by active status (true/false)
- `status` - Filter by verification status

### Getting Latest Version

Agents can retrieve the latest active version:

```http
GET /api/binary/latest?type=hashcat
X-API-Key: <agent_api_key>
```

## Platform-Specific Considerations

### Linux

The system automatically handles Linux-specific binary names:
- Checks for both `hashcat` and `hashcat.bin`
- Sets executable permissions (0750) on extracted binaries

### Windows

- Looks for `hashcat.exe` in extracted archives
- Handles Windows-specific path separators

### Archive Extraction

The extraction process intelligently handles common archive structures:
- Single directory archives: Contents are moved to the target directory
- Multi-file archives: All files are extracted as-is
- Nested structures: Properly flattened during extraction

## Binary Synchronization to Agents

### Agent Download Process

Agents download binaries through the following process:

1. **Version Check**: Agent queries for the latest active version
2. **Download Request**: Agent requests binary download by version ID
3. **Authentication**: API key authentication is required
4. **Streaming Download**: Binary is streamed to the agent
5. **Local Verification**: Agent verifies MD5 hash after download

### API Endpoints for Agents

```http
# Get latest version metadata
GET /api/binary/latest?type=hashcat
X-API-Key: <agent_api_key>

# Download specific version
GET /api/binary/download/{version_id}
X-API-Key: <agent_api_key>
```

### Synchronization Protocol

The agent file sync system (`agent/internal/sync/sync.go`) handles:
- Concurrent downloads with configurable limits
- Retry logic for failed downloads
- Local caching to avoid re-downloads
- Integrity verification with MD5 hashes

## Updating and Replacing Binaries

### Adding a New Version

To add a new version of hashcat:

1. Upload the new version via the admin API
2. The system automatically downloads and verifies it
3. Previous versions remain available but can be deactivated

### Deactivating Old Versions

```http
DELETE /api/admin/binary/{version_id}
Authorization: Bearer <admin_token>
```

This will:
- Mark the version as inactive (`is_active = false`)
- Set verification status to `deleted`
- Remove the binary file from disk
- Preserve the database record for audit purposes

### Version Verification

To manually verify a binary's integrity:

```http
POST /api/admin/binary/{version_id}/verify
Authorization: Bearer <admin_token>
```

This will:
- Check if the file exists on disk
- Recalculate the MD5 hash
- Compare with stored hash
- Update verification status and timestamp

## Best Practices and Security

### Security Considerations

1. **Source URLs**: Only download binaries from trusted sources
   - Official hashcat releases: https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/releases
   - Verify SSL certificates for download sources

2. **Hash Verification**: Always verify MD5 hashes after download
   - The system automatically calculates and stores hashes
   - Manual verification can be triggered via API

3. **Access Control**: Binary management requires admin privileges
   - Only administrators can add/remove binaries
   - Agents have read-only access for downloads

4. **File Permissions**: Extracted binaries have restricted permissions (0750)
   - Only the application user can execute binaries
   - Group members have read access

### Operational Best Practices

1. **Version Testing**: Test new binary versions before deployment
   - Upload to a test environment first
   - Verify extraction and execution work correctly
   - Check compatibility with existing jobs

2. **Retention Policy**: Maintain a reasonable number of versions
   - Keep at least 2-3 recent versions for rollback
   - Delete very old versions to save storage space
   - Archive important versions externally

3. **Monitoring**: Regular verification of binary integrity
   - Schedule periodic verification checks
   - Monitor download failures in logs
   - Track agent synchronization success rates

4. **Documentation**: Document version changes
   - Note any breaking changes between versions
   - Track performance improvements
   - Document known issues with specific versions

### Storage Management

1. **Disk Space**: Monitor available disk space
   - Binary archives can be large (100MB+)
   - Extracted binaries double the storage requirement
   - Plan for growth with multiple versions

2. **Cleanup**: Regular cleanup of old versions
   - Delete inactive versions after confirming they're not needed
   - Remove failed download attempts
   - Clean up orphaned extraction directories

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Download Failures**
   - Check network connectivity to source URL
   - Verify SSL/TLS certificates are valid
   - Check firewall rules for outbound HTTPS
   - Review logs for specific error messages

2. **Extraction Failures**
   - Ensure required tools are installed (7z, unzip, tar)
   - Check disk space for extraction
   - Verify archive isn't corrupted
   - Check file permissions on data directory

3. **Verification Failures**
   - File may be corrupted during download
   - Source file may have changed
   - Disk errors could cause corruption
   - Try re-downloading the binary

### Log Locations

Binary management logs are written to:
- Backend logs: Check for `[Binary Manager]` entries
- Download attempts: Look for HTTP client errors
- Extraction logs: Command output is logged
- Verification results: Hash comparison details

### Manual Recovery

If automated processes fail:

1. **Manual Download**: Download binary to a temporary location
2. **Manual Upload**: Place in `<data_dir>/binaries/<version_id>/`
3. **Update Database**: Set correct hash and file size
4. **Manual Extraction**: Extract to local directory
5. **Verify Permissions**: Ensure correct file permissions

## Version.json File

The `versions.json` file in the repository root tracks component versions:

```json
{
    "backend": "0.1.0",
    "frontend": "0.1.0",
    "agent": "0.1.0",
    "api": "0.1.0",
    "database": "0.1.0"
}
```

This file is used for:
- Build-time version embedding
- API version compatibility checks
- Component version tracking
- Release management

Note: This tracks KrakenHashes component versions, not binary tool versions.
