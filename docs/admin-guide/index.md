## First-Time Setup Sequence

When setting up KrakenHashes for the first time, follow this sequence:

1. **Upload Hashcat Binary** (Required First)
   - Navigate to Admin → Binary Management
   - Upload a compressed hashcat binary (.7z, .zip, .tar.gz)
   - Wait for verification to complete
   - This triggers creation of system preset jobs including the potfile job

2. **Verify Potfile Initialization**
   - Check Resources → Wordlists for "Pot-file" entry
   - Check Admin → Preset Jobs for "Potfile Run" job
   - Both should exist after binary upload

3. **Continue with Standard Setup**
   - Upload wordlists
   - Configure agents
   - Create hashlists
