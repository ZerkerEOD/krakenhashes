# SSL/TLS Setup Guide for KrakenHashes

This guide explains how to set up and trust the self-signed SSL certificates used by KrakenHashes on various platforms.

## Overview

KrakenHashes uses self-signed certificates by default to secure communications between components. When you first access the web interface, your browser will warn you about the untrusted certificate. This is expected behavior for self-signed certificates.

To avoid these warnings, you need to install the KrakenHashes Certificate Authority (CA) certificate as a trusted root certificate on your system.

## Downloading the CA Certificate

The CA certificate can be downloaded from:
- **HTTP endpoint**: `http://your-server:1337/ca.crt`
- **Via the web interface**: When you see the certificate warning, there's usually an option to download the CA certificate

Save the file as `krakenhashes-ca.crt` for the following instructions.

## Installation Instructions by Platform

### Linux Systems

#### Debian/Ubuntu

1. Copy the CA certificate to the system certificate directory:
   ```bash
   sudo cp krakenhashes-ca.crt /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/
   ```

2. Update the certificate store:
   ```bash
   sudo update-ca-certificates
   ```

3. You should see output indicating the certificate was added:
   ```
   Updating certificates in /etc/ssl/certs...
   1 added, 0 removed; done.
   ```

#### Fedora/RHEL/CentOS/Rocky Linux

1. Copy the CA certificate to the trust anchors directory:
   ```bash
   sudo cp krakenhashes-ca.crt /etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors/
   ```

2. Update the trust store:
   ```bash
   sudo update-ca-trust
   ```

#### Arch Linux

**Using trust anchor command (Recommended):**
```bash
# This is the official Arch way - it handles everything automatically
sudo trust anchor --store krakenhashes-ca.crt
```

Note: The `trust anchor --store` command automatically:
- Places the certificate in `/etc/ca-certificates/trust-source/anchors/`
- Updates the trust database with `update-ca-trust`
- Handles p11-kit integration properly

#### Additional Step for Chrome/Chromium on Linux

Chrome and Chromium browsers maintain their own certificate store on Linux. After installing the system certificate, you also need to:

1. Install the certificate in the NSS database:
   ```bash
   certutil -d sql:$HOME/.pki/nssdb -A -t "CP,CP," -n "KrakenHashes Root CA" -i krakenhashes-ca.crt
   ```

2. Restart Chrome/Chromium for the changes to take effect.

To verify the certificate was installed:
```bash
certutil -d sql:$HOME/.pki/nssdb -L
```

To remove the certificate later if needed:
```bash
certutil -d sql:$HOME/.pki/nssdb -D -n "KrakenHashes Root CA"
```

### Windows

#### Using Certificate Manager (GUI)

1. Press `Win + R`, type `certmgr.msc`, and press Enter
2. Navigate to "Trusted Root Certification Authorities" > "Certificates"
3. Right-click on "Certificates" and select "All Tasks" > "Import..."
4. Follow the Certificate Import Wizard:
   - Click "Next"
   - Browse and select the `krakenhashes-ca.crt` file
   - Click "Next"
   - Ensure "Place all certificates in the following store" is selected with "Trusted Root Certification Authorities"
   - Click "Next" and then "Finish"
5. When prompted with a security warning, click "Yes" to install the certificate

#### Using PowerShell (Administrator)

```powershell
# Import the certificate to the Trusted Root store
Import-Certificate -FilePath "C:\path\to\krakenhashes-ca.crt" -CertStoreLocation Cert:\LocalMachine\Root
```

#### Using Command Prompt (Administrator)

```cmd
certutil -addstore "Root" "C:\path\to\krakenhashes-ca.crt"
```

### macOS

#### Using Keychain Access (GUI)

1. Double-click the `krakenhashes-ca.crt` file
2. Keychain Access will open
3. Select "System" keychain (you may need to authenticate)
4. The certificate will be added but marked as untrusted
5. Double-click on the "KrakenHashes Root CA" certificate
6. Expand the "Trust" section
7. Change "When using this certificate" to "Always Trust"
8. Close the window and authenticate to save changes

#### Using Command Line

```bash
# Add certificate to system keychain
sudo security add-trusted-cert -d -r trustRoot -k /Library/Keychains/System.keychain krakenhashes-ca.crt
```

## Verification

After installing the certificate, you can verify it's working:

1. **Browser Test**: Navigate to `https://your-server:31337` - you should no longer see certificate warnings
2. **Command Line Test**: 
   ```bash
   curl https://your-server:31337/health
   # Should work without certificate errors
   ```

## Certificate Details

The self-signed certificates generated by KrakenHashes include:

- **CA Certificate**: Valid for 10 years (3650 days)
- **Server Certificate**: Valid for 1 year (365 days)
- **Key Size**: 4096-bit RSA (configurable)
- **Extensions**: 
  - SubjectKeyIdentifier and AuthorityKeyIdentifier for proper chain validation
  - BasicConstraints properly set (CA:TRUE for CA, CA:FALSE for server)
  - Appropriate KeyUsage and ExtendedKeyUsage flags

## Environment Variables

You can customize certificate generation with these environment variables:

- `KH_ADDITIONAL_DNS_NAMES`: Comma-separated additional DNS names (e.g., "krakenhashes.local,kraken.internal")
- `KH_ADDITIONAL_IP_ADDRESSES`: Comma-separated additional IP addresses (e.g., "192.168.1.100,10.0.0.50")
- `KH_CERT_KEY_SIZE`: RSA key size (2048 or 4096, default: 4096)
- `KH_CERT_VALIDITY_DAYS`: Server certificate validity in days (default: 365)
- `KH_CA_VALIDITY_DAYS`: CA certificate validity in days (default: 3650)

## Security Considerations

1. **Self-signed certificates** are suitable for:
   - Development environments
   - Internal networks
   - Testing and staging
   - Environments where you control all clients

2. **For production use**, consider:
   - Using certificates from a trusted CA (Let's Encrypt, etc.)
   - Implementing proper certificate rotation
   - Using the `certbot` mode if you have a public domain

3. **Certificate Storage**:
   - Private keys are stored with 0600 permissions
   - Certificates are stored in the configured certs directory
   - Default location: `~/.krakenhashes/certs/` or `/etc/krakenhashes/certs/` in Docker

## Regenerating Certificates

If you need to regenerate certificates (e.g., to add new SANs):

1. Stop the KrakenHashes backend
2. Delete the existing certificates:
   ```bash
   rm -rf ~/.krakenhashes/certs/*
   # Or your configured certs directory
   ```
3. Start the backend - new certificates will be generated automatically
4. Reinstall the new CA certificate on client systems

## Certificate Modes

KrakenHashes supports three TLS modes:

1. **self-signed** (default): Automatically generates and manages certificates
2. **provided**: Use your own certificates (set paths via environment variables)
3. **certbot**: Integration with Let's Encrypt for public domains

To change modes, set the `KH_TLS_MODE` environment variable.

## Certbot Mode (Let's Encrypt)

This mode allows you to use Let's Encrypt certificates via Certbot with Cloudflare DNS-01 challenge. This is ideal for internal applications that aren't publicly accessible.

### Prerequisites

1. **Domain Name**: You need to own a domain (e.g., `zerkersec.io`)
2. **Cloudflare Account**: Your domain must be managed by Cloudflare
3. **API Token**: Create a Cloudflare API token with proper permissions

### Step 1: Create Cloudflare API Token

1. Log in to your Cloudflare dashboard
2. Go to **My Profile** → **API Tokens**
3. Click **Create Token**
4. Use the **Custom token** template with these permissions:
   - **Zone** → **DNS** → **Edit**
   - **Zone** → **Zone** → **Read** (optional but recommended)
5. Under **Zone Resources**, select:
   - **Include** → **Specific zone** → Your domain (e.g., `zerkersec.io`)
6. Click **Continue to summary** and **Create Token**
7. **Save the token securely** - you won't be able to see it again!

### Step 2: DNS Configuration

Create an A record for your subdomain:

1. In Cloudflare dashboard, go to your domain
2. Navigate to **DNS** → **Records**
3. Add a new A record:
   - **Type**: A
   - **Name**: `kraken` (or your chosen subdomain)
   - **IPv4 address**: Your internal IP (e.g., `10.0.0.100`)
   - **Proxy status**: DNS only (gray cloud)
   - **TTL**: Auto

**Note**: The IP address doesn't need to be publicly accessible. Certbot only needs to verify domain ownership via DNS TXT records.

### Step 3: Configure KrakenHashes

Edit your `.env` file:

```bash
# Change TLS mode to certbot
KH_TLS_MODE=certbot

# Certbot Configuration
KH_CERTBOT_DOMAIN=kraken.zerkersec.io    # Your full domain
KH_CERTBOT_EMAIL=admin@zerkersec.io      # Your email for Let's Encrypt
KH_CERTBOT_STAGING=true                  # Start with staging for testing!
KH_CERTBOT_AUTO_RENEW=true               # Enable automatic renewal

# Cloudflare Configuration
CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN=your-token-here     # The token from Step 1

# Update frontend URLs to use your domain
REACT_APP_API_URL=https://kraken.zerkersec.io:31337
REACT_APP_WS_URL=wss://kraken.zerkersec.io:31337

# Update CORS to allow your domain
CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGIN=https://kraken.zerkersec.io
```

### Step 4: Initial Setup with Staging

**Important**: Always test with Let's Encrypt staging environment first to avoid rate limits!

1. Stop existing containers:
   ```bash
   docker-compose down
   ```

2. Start with certbot mode:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

3. Monitor the logs:
   ```bash
   docker-compose logs -f krakenhashes
   ```

4. Look for messages indicating successful certificate generation:
   ```
   Obtaining certificates for domain: kraken.zerkersec.io
   Successfully obtained certificates
   ```

### Step 5: Verify Staging Certificates

1. Check certificate files:
   ```bash
   ls -la kh-backend/config/certs/live/kraken.zerkersec.io/
   ```

2. You should see:
   - `fullchain.pem` - Certificate chain
   - `privkey.pem` - Private key
   - `chain.pem` - Intermediate certificates
   - `cert.pem` - Domain certificate

3. Test the application (you'll get a browser warning for staging certificates)

### Step 6: Switch to Production

Once staging certificates work:

1. Update `.env`:
   ```bash
   KH_CERTBOT_STAGING=false
   ```

2. Remove staging certificates:
   ```bash
   rm -rf kh-backend/config/certs/live/*
   rm -rf kh-backend/config/certs/archive/*
   rm -rf kh-backend/config/certs/renewal/*
   ```

3. Restart to get production certificates:
   ```bash
   docker-compose down
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

### Certificate Renewal

Certificates are automatically renewed:

- Renewal checks run twice daily (3 AM and 3 PM)
- Certificates renew when less than 30 days remain
- Services reload automatically after renewal

**Manual Renewal**:
```bash
docker exec krakenhashes /usr/local/bin/certbot-renew.sh
```

**Monitor Renewal**:
```bash
docker exec krakenhashes tail -f /var/log/krakenhashes/certbot-renew.log
```

### Certbot Troubleshooting

#### Common Issues

1. **"CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN environment variable is required"**
   - Ensure the token is set in your `.env` file
   - Token must have DNS:Edit permissions

2. **"Failed to obtain certificates"**
   - Check Cloudflare API token permissions
   - Verify domain ownership
   - Check certbot logs: `docker exec krakenhashes cat /etc/krakenhashes/certs/logs/letsencrypt.log`

3. **Browser still shows certificate warnings**
   - Ensure you switched from staging to production
   - Clear browser cache
   - Verify certificates: `docker exec krakenhashes openssl x509 -in /etc/krakenhashes/certs/live/kraken.zerkersec.io/cert.pem -text -noout`

4. **Rate Limits**
   - Let's Encrypt has rate limits (50 certificates per domain per week)
   - Always test with staging first
   - See: https://letsencrypt.org/docs/rate-limits/

#### Certificate Information

View certificate details:
```bash
# Inside container
docker exec krakenhashes certbot certificates --config-dir /etc/krakenhashes/certs

# Certificate expiry
docker exec krakenhashes openssl x509 -enddate -noout -in /etc/krakenhashes/certs/live/kraken.zerkersec.io/cert.pem
```

### Additional Domains

To add more domains/subdomains:

1. Add them to `KH_ADDITIONAL_DNS_NAMES` in `.env`:
   ```bash
   KH_ADDITIONAL_DNS_NAMES=kraken.zerkersec.io,api.zerkersec.io,*.kraken.zerkersec.io
   ```

2. Ensure all domains are in Cloudflare and accessible by your API token

3. Restart the container to obtain certificates for all domains

### Migration from Self-Signed

If migrating from self-signed certificates:

1. Back up existing certificates (optional)
2. Update `.env` as shown above
3. Restart containers
4. Update any clients/browsers that have the old CA certificate cached

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Browser Still Shows Certificate Warnings

1. **Certificate not properly installed**:
   - Verify the certificate is in the correct store (Trusted Root, not Personal or Intermediate)
   - Check that you installed the CA certificate, not the server certificate
   - Some browsers cache certificate decisions - try clearing browser data or using incognito mode

2. **Browser-specific issues**:
   - **Chrome/Edge**: May require restart after certificate installation
   - **Firefox**: Has its own certificate store - you may need to import via Firefox settings
   - **Safari**: Requires explicit trust settings in Keychain Access

3. **Certificate regenerated**:
   - If the backend regenerated certificates, you need to reinstall the new CA certificate
   - Remove the old certificate first to avoid conflicts

#### ERR_SSL_KEY_USAGE_INCOMPATIBLE (Chrome/Edge)

This error indicates the certificate doesn't have the correct key usage flags. The updated certificate generation should prevent this, but if you encounter it:

1. Ensure you're running the latest version with the certificate improvements
2. Delete existing certificates and let them regenerate
3. As a temporary workaround on Windows:
   ```powershell
   # Create registry key to disable the check (use with caution)
   New-ItemProperty -Path "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Edge" -Name "RSAKeyUsageForLocalAnchorsEnabled" -Value 0 -PropertyType DWORD
   # For Chrome:
   New-ItemProperty -Path "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Policies\Google\Chrome" -Name "RSAKeyUsageForLocalAnchorsEnabled" -Value 0 -PropertyType DWORD
   ```

#### Certificate Not Trusted on Linux

1. **Check certificate format**:
   ```bash
   # Verify it's a valid PEM certificate
   openssl x509 -in krakenhashes-ca.crt -text -noout
   ```

2. **Verify installation**:
   ```bash
   # Check if certificate is in the trust store
   trust list | grep -i krakenhashes
   
   # For Debian/Ubuntu, check the symlink was created
   ls -la /etc/ssl/certs/ | grep krakenhashes
   ```

3. **SELinux issues** (RHEL/Fedora):
   ```bash
   # Check for SELinux denials
   sudo ausearch -m avc -ts recent
   
   # If needed, restore context
   sudo restorecon -v /etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors/krakenhashes-ca.crt
   ```

#### Certificate Chain Issues

1. **Verify the full chain is being sent**:
   ```bash
   # Check what certificates the server is presenting
   openssl s_client -connect your-server:31337 -showcerts
   ```

2. **Validate certificate chain**:
   ```bash
   # Download server certificate
   echo | openssl s_client -connect your-server:31337 -servername your-server 2>/dev/null | \
     openssl x509 > server.crt
   
   # Verify against CA
   openssl verify -CAfile krakenhashes-ca.crt server.crt
   ```

#### Connection Refused or Timeout

1. **Check the service is running**:
   ```bash
   # Check if ports are listening
   netstat -tlnp | grep -E "1337|31337"
   # or
   ss -tlnp | grep -E "1337|31337"
   ```

2. **Firewall rules**:
   ```bash
   # Check firewall status
   sudo iptables -L -n | grep -E "1337|31337"
   # or for firewalld
   sudo firewall-cmd --list-all
   ```

3. **Docker networking** (if using Docker):
   - Ensure ports are properly mapped in docker-compose.yml
   - Check Docker network connectivity

### Diagnostic Commands

### Removing Old Certificates

If you need to remove old certificates before installing new ones:

**Arch Linux:**
```bash
# Find and remove the certificate
sudo rm -f /etc/ca-certificates/trust-source/anchors/krakenhashes-ca.crt
sudo update-ca-trust

# Or use trust anchor to remove by name
sudo trust anchor --remove "KrakenHashes Root CA"

# Remove from Chrome/Chromium
certutil -d sql:$HOME/.pki/nssdb -D -n "KrakenHashes Root CA"
```

**Debian/Ubuntu:**
```bash
sudo rm /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/krakenhashes-ca.crt
sudo update-ca-certificates --fresh
```

**Fedora/RHEL:**
```bash
sudo rm /etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors/krakenhashes-ca.crt
sudo update-ca-trust
```

### Getting Help

If you're still experiencing issues:

1. Check the backend logs for certificate generation errors:
   ```bash
   grep -i "certificate\|tls\|ssl" /path/to/backend.log
   ```

2. Ensure your environment variables are set correctly
3. Try regenerating certificates with a clean state
