## Data Security

### Password Hash Protection

KrakenHashes handles sensitive password hash data. Follow these practices:

- **Access Control**: Limit access to hashlists based on roles and teams
- **Client Isolation**: Hashlists are associated with specific clients for data segregation
- **Secure Storage**: Hash files stored with restricted permissions in `/var/lib/krakenhashes/hashlists/`
- **No Plaintext Logging**: System never logs recovered passwords or sensitive hash values

### Cracked Password Handling

- Passwords stored only in database after successful crack
- No automatic export of cracked passwords
- Access to cracked passwords requires authentication
- Potfile managed separately with controlled access

!!! warning "Potfile Security"
    The potfile (`/var/lib/krakenhashes/wordlists/custom/potfile.txt`) contains plaintext passwords from ALL cracked hashes and is **NOT** affected by the retention system. This means:
    - Passwords remain in the potfile even after hashlists are deleted
    - The potfile grows indefinitely unless manually managed
    - May conflict with data protection compliance requirements
    - Must be secured with strict file permissions and access controls

## Data Retention Security

### Secure Data Deletion

The retention system implements multiple layers of secure deletion to prevent data recovery:

#### 1. File System Security

When files are deleted due to retention policies:

- **Random Overwrite**: Files are overwritten with random data before deletion
- **Multiple Passes**: Sensitive data overwritten in 4KB chunks
- **Immediate Removal**: Files removed from filesystem after overwrite
- **No Recovery**: Prevents standard file recovery tools from retrieving data

Implementation:
```go
// Files are overwritten with random data
randomData := make([]byte, 4096)
for written < fileInfo.Size() {
    rand.Read(randomData)
    file.Write(randomData)
}
os.Remove(filePath)
```

#### 2. Database Security

Database records are protected against recovery:

- **Transaction Safety**: All deletions occur within database transactions
- **CASCADE Deletion**: Related records automatically removed via foreign key constraints
- **Orphan Cleanup**: Hashes not linked to any hashlist are deleted
- **VACUUM Operations**: PostgreSQL VACUUM ANALYZE prevents recovery from:
  - Dead tuples in heap files
  - Write-Ahead Log (WAL) entries
  - Transaction logs

Affected tables during retention purge:
- `hashlists` (primary target)
- `hashlist_hashes` (associations)
- `hashes` (orphaned entries)
- `agent_hashlists` (distribution records)
- `job_executions` (job history)
- `job_tasks` (task assignments)

#### 3. Agent-Side Cleanup

Agents automatically clean temporary files:

- **3-Day Retention**: Temporary files removed after 3 days
- **Automatic Process**: Runs every 6 hours
- **Protected Resources**: Base files (binaries, wordlists, rules) never auto-deleted
- **Storage Management**: Prevents disk space exhaustion on compute nodes

### Retention Policy Configuration

- **System Default**: Configurable default retention period for all data
- **Client-Specific**: Per-client retention overrides for compliance
- **Audit Trail**: All deletions logged with timestamp and affected records
- **Manual Override**: Administrators can trigger immediate purge if needed

### Potfile Exclusion from Retention

!!! danger "Critical Security Gap"
    The potfile is **NOT** managed by the retention system and requires separate security procedures:

    **Security Implications:**
    - Plaintext passwords persist indefinitely in the potfile
    - Deleted hashlist passwords remain recoverable from potfile
    - No automatic cleanup when clients/hashlists are deleted
    - Potential compliance violation for GDPR/data protection laws

    **Required Actions:**
    1. Implement manual potfile cleanup procedures
    2. Create audit trail for potfile modifications
    3. Consider encrypting the potfile at rest
    4. Restrict potfile access to minimum required personnel
    5. Document potfile retention policy separately for compliance

## Authentication & Access Control

### Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

KrakenHashes supports multiple MFA methods:

- **TOTP**: Time-based One-Time Passwords via authenticator apps
- **Email**: Verification codes sent to registered email
- **Backup Codes**: Recovery codes for emergency access

### Password Security

- **Bcrypt Hashing**: All passwords hashed with bcrypt
- **Configurable Requirements**: Min length, complexity rules
- **Password History**: Prevents password reuse
- **Account Lockout**: Automatic lockout after failed attempts

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

System roles with increasing privileges:

1. **User**: Standard access to assigned resources
2. **Admin**: Full system administration
3. **Agent**: Agent-specific operations only
4. **System**: Internal system operations

### JWT Token Security

- **Short-Lived Access Tokens**: 15-minute default expiry
- **Refresh Token Rotation**: New refresh token on each use
- **Secure Storage**: Tokens never logged or stored in plaintext
- **Revocation Support**: Immediate token invalidation

## Network Security

### TLS/SSL Configuration

Multiple TLS modes supported:

1. **Self-Signed Certificates**
   - Automatic generation with proper extensions
   - Browser-compatible certificates
   - Full certificate chain support

2. **Provided Certificates**
   - Custom certificate installation
   - Certificate validation
   - Chain verification

3. **Let's Encrypt**
   - Automatic renewal via ACME
   - Production-ready certificates

### API Security

- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents abuse and DoS attacks
- **CORS Configuration**: Controlled cross-origin access
- **Request Validation**: Input sanitization and validation
- **API Key Authentication**: Secure agent authentication

## Agent Security

### Registration Security

- **Claim Codes**: One-time or continuous registration codes
- **API Key Generation**: Unique keys per agent
- **Certificate Exchange**: TLS certificate verification
- **Voucher Expiration**: Time-limited registration windows

### Communication Security

- **WebSocket over TLS**: Encrypted agent communication
- **Heartbeat Monitoring**: Detect disconnected agents
- **Message Authentication**: Signed messages prevent tampering
- **Command Authorization**: Agents verify command sources

### File Synchronization

- **Checksum Verification**: MD5/SHA validation of transferred files
- **Partial Downloads**: Resume support for large files
- **Access Control**: Agents access only assigned files
- **Cleanup Policy**: Automatic removal of unused files

## Database Security

### Connection Security
